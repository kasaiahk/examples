AngularJS:
----------
    - AngularJS is the client side javascript framework.

    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model
            - javascript variables called as model in angularjs.

            Ex.
                var data = "Data from DataBase Soon...!";

        [Note : where "data" variable called as model in angular js]

        V - View

            - We can use HTML / HTML 5 / JADE used as View in angular js.

        C - Controller
            - java script functions called as Controllers in angular js

            Ex.
                function ctrl(){
                   //Business Logic
                }

        [Note : where "ctrl" called as controller in angular js]


- AngularJS Used to Develop the Web Applications.

- We can develop the Web Applications by using JavaScript.

- The Vendor for AngularJS is Google.



Advantages Of AngularJS:
------------------------
1. Open Source Code

    - As a Developer we can customize the framework accroding to application
      requirement.

    Ex.
        angular js  + "our own features"  ===>  "our own framework"


2. AngularJS Supports Modules (Predefined Modules & Custom Modules)

    [Module : collection of predefined functionality]

1. ngAnimate
    - this module used to develop the Animations in angular applications

2. ngStorage
    - this module used to work with the Storages.

    - we have two types of Storages.

        1. localStorage
        2. sessionStorage

3. ngMessages
    - this module used to work with the validations.



Disadvantages of AngularJS:
---------------------------

1. We are missing the Secuirity because we are  
   implementing the Business components at client  
   side.

2. Understanding the angular applications are  
   difficult because of no coding standards
   given by vendor.

3. We must enable the JavaScript in 
   Browser settings. 


Key features of AngularJS:
--------------------------

1. directives
    - directives in angular enhances the HTML   
      capabilities

    - we have two types of directives

        1. predefined directives  
            - the directives given by the angular
              framework called as predefined directives.

            Ex.
                ng-app
                ng-model
                ng-bind

        2. Custom directives
            - the directives developed based on
              application requirement called as
              Custom directives.

            Ex.
                my_dir

    2. Controllers              
        - Controllers in angularjs acting as
          glue between View and Model.

        - we can have more than one controller Per
          web application.

        - we can declare the Controllers by
          using "ng-controller" directive.

        Ex.
            <div ng-controller="ctrl_one">

            </div>

            <h1 ng-controller="ctrl_two"></h1>

        - in general we will implement the
          Business logic in service layers.


3. services
    - services are used to create the 
      common Business logic.

    - by using services we can eliminate
      the data redundency.

    - we can inject the services to Controllers

    - injecting the one component to another
      component called as Dependency Injectction

    - we have two types of services

        1. predefined services
            - given by the framework.

        Ex.
            $http

        2. Custom services
            - user defined services

        Ex.
            my_service


4. Single Page Applications

- loading the one template to another template
  with out refreshing the whole web page called  
  as Single Page Application.

- loading the one template to another template
  in "Single page application" called as "routing"

- we can implement the routing by using Following
  modules.
    1. ngRoute
    2. ui.router

5. filters
    - filters are used to format the application
      data accroding to application requirement.

    - we have two types of filters.
        1. predefined filters
            - given by framework.

        Ex.
            orderBy

        2. Custom filters
            - user defined filters.
        Ex.
            my_filter


Comparision Of AngularJS - Angular4
------------------------------------

    - The Vendor for the AngularJS is Google.
      The Vendor for Angular4 is Google and Microsoft.

    - By using AngularJS we can develop 
      web applications.
      By using Angular4 we can develop 
      web and mobile applications.


[Note : we can develop the mobile applications with
        the help of ionic framework
        
        Angular4 + ionic ===> mobile application]


- we can develop the angularJS applications by using
  javascript.

  we can Angular4 applications by using TypeScript.

 [Note : we must convert the TypeScript to JavaScript
 
        converting the TypeScript to javascript called as
        transpilation.
        
        "tsc" compiler used for transpilation.]

- JavaScript script is the scripting language based on
  intrepeters.         
  TypeScript is programming language based on compiler.


- AngularJS have a poor performance compared to Angular4
  Angular4 have a "5 X" more performance compared to AngularJS.


- Angular4 easy compared to AngularJS.
  

Comparision of AngularJS to NodeJS
----------------------------------

    - AngularJS is the client side javascript framework.
      NodeJS is the server side javascript framework.

    - AngularJS used to develop the web applications.
      NodeJS used to develop the servers(Http & TCP).

Differences between AngularJS to reactJS
-----------------------------------------
    - AngularJS is the framework.
      reactJS is the library.

    - AngularJS shows the poor performance with data structures.
      reactJS Good while implementing Data structures in applications.
